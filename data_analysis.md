# Task 3b. Data analysis

---

## Description

Data analysis on the [netflix_titles.csv](data/netflix_titles.csv) including:
1. The use of word counts on the description column to find some kind of "topics". You have the freedom to set the details for the analysis, e.g. you can use the word counts to find out "the most used words for each Genre". And remember now the NLP tools are available for you to use
2. List the pairs of actors or actresses / actors and directors that often work together
3. Some more data analyses what you want to conduct with the data

You may want to use this as an opportunity to show your `Pandas`/`Numpy` skills. Feel free to use any other datasets as well.

## Note

Please have a look of the data analysis from the "Outstanding PS5 submissions" to see what level of data analysis you are expected to do in order to get a high mark. You do NOT need to use fancy models, but the analysis should be well-motivated, sensible and actually trying to find out something (rather than box-ticking).
